Contents:
- A "main.cpp" file which the program will run from
- Example json file called "untitled.json"

Running:
To run the file open the terminal in the directory with the main.cpp and untitled.json file.
Use the command:
	g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main
to compile the file and then the command:
